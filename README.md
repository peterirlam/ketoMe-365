## 🎱 Why I Chose This Project
I wanted to showcase my ability in creating a visually striking landing page writing my own 'copy' (content) rather than Lorem placeholder text.  
I built the project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with particular focus on CSS for a fully responsive and highly accessible
user experience. 

## 🏗️ How I Worked on This Project
- I used git to track my files locally and created branches using git switch -c new-branch.
- I designed a rough paper sketch of the layout of each section so I had a mental model of html elements.
- I envisioned user goals, what they wanted to accomplish and established consistent design patterns to reinforce UI/UX principles
- For future projects I intend to explore using Jira for a more formal project management experience. 

## ⏲️ If I Had More Time I Would Change

Add more branding colors. I approached the project using a green branding color, synonymous with health and vitality. I used tints and
shades of the primary color to provide visual hierarchy for a better user experience. 

However, I feel that the design needs additional brand colors, especially for the pricing section which indicates the 3-tier pricing structure. I will return to this project soon, add css variables for all colors and add a wider range of color palettes.
